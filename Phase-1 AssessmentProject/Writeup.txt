The flow and features of the application:

problem statement: creating a protocol of file handling to perform 
various methods like add, delete, search, sort and end application through 
user interaction in console/command line output
	 
	 Basically writing a java code, where operations are planned to be 
	 completed in 3 sprints 
	 
	 1.Retrieve & set files in ascending order(sorting)
	 2.Performing business level operations
	 		A)add--creating a file
	  		B)delete--delete an existing file
	  		C)search--search an existing file
	  		D)Go Back--just breaking the loop
	 3.Close the application
	
Used the following:

1.Eclipse: An IDE to code for the application 
2.Java: A programming language to develop the prototype 
3.Git: To connect and push files from the local system to GitHub 
4.GitHub: To store the application code and track its versions 
5.Scrum: An efficient agile framework to deliver the product incrementally 
6.Search and Sort techniques are used in the project 
7.Implemented the concepts such as exceptions, collections, and sorting techniques 
 for source code optimization and increased performance
